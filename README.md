# Team 3 Opportunity Hacks 2017

## Inspiration

There are children and adults out in the world that lack some of the basic functions that most people consider make a person human. In an attempt to treat those suffering from various debilitating conditions Neurologic Music Therapy Services of Arizona (NMTSA) is working to pair the people that need the therapy with the therapists that can provide the therapy. One of the problems that NMTSA is currently facing is that they are unable to provide as much care as they want because they therapists must fill out similar reports by hand. This is where we come in. 

## What it does

Our product is a user portal that allows the clients to view their information such as, insurance, up coming appointments, previous appointments, and the other documentation that goes along with their therapy. The therapists may view and use the information provided by the users to generate the different reports that they must fill out so that the majority of patient information is already filled in. This allows the therapists to spend less time filling out paper work and more time helping people. 

## How we built it

The product was built using a Postgresql database for the storing of information. This is accessed through a REST api built with Flask in python for use with the AngularJS front end.
